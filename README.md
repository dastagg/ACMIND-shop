# shop

A Flutter tutorial application by Academind.

## Description

This tutorial focuses on State and State Management using the Provider Package.

It is an applcation that represents a Shop (or Store) with Products for sale and contains various pages that display Products, Orders, and a Shopping Cart.

Note: I deleted the previous version I pushed up to Github because:
  - I decided to switch to different tutorials when I was only 1/4 of the way through this to learn more in depth about certain things.
  - I was using either Android Studio or Vim and with this application I switched to VSCode.
  - I am using a two branch (trunk/develop) git flow to become more comfortable with merging branches.
